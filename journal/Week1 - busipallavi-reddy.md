# Week 1



### What tasks did I work on / complete?

- Worked with team members to decide on what use case we are going to pick as our team project. 
- Explored the various project ideas :
  * Streaming application - discussed about building a SAAS like youtube or netflix, where continuous video streaming data has to be provided to the customers. This would include providing the customers with the content based on their geographical location like in a CDN. Exploring Amazon CloudFront for this purpose.
  * Shopping Cart - Like the Amazon's shopping cart, a distributed system which maintains the state of a shopping cart.
  * Forum application - Like Quora, a forum where many users talk and comment on posts.
  * Restaurant Ordering system - Like Counter burger, designing an application to place online orders.
